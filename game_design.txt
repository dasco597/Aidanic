you play as pho from land of the lustrous with a little rodent friend who's always sick of this shit
loop stages:
1) landscape is shit, mechanical animals are dormant
2) wake up the animals, they go nuts, landscape goes crazy
3) calm them down (turn key or some shit, bigger fellas need to be climbed on and worn down) landscape calms down
4) explore the environment for collectables and shit

why? player has a lot of freedom to control pacing, they have to initiate the gameplay by waking homies up!
special moves to chain waking up, need some kind of incentive to fight everyone at once, maybe powerups that help with fighting multiple enimies?
training area with 'sloth' variants that go back to sleep after being woken (landscape change is permanent) giving you infinite play time

core design:
fun and goofy, it's what I like and what I'm good at
not too serious and then people won't take it as seriously so they'll have more fun

failure:
death? creates a quick reset, no fucking around once you know you're done for.

expansion:
3 distinct character operation modes with different move-sets/items: exploration mode, waking animals up mode, animal combat mode
waking up skills, wake up everyone at once!
dynamic music, vertical for gameplay stages (levels should be cohesive), horizontal for level transitions

graphics:
translucent land of the lustrous teal hair! ray tracing bitch!
use procedural generation wherever possible to create a unique graphical feel
static time of day? area consistency. weather changes with gameplay loop sections?
